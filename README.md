# Description
The project is similiar to the multi stage verification tech used in big companies, government for security. It consists of a fingerprint scanning, followed by a face recognition system to provide double security. The face recognition is initiated only if the finger print scan scores a match in its database. Once a match is hit, face recognition is enabled. If both the stages gets a match, access is granted. We will be dealing with the 2 stages here.
